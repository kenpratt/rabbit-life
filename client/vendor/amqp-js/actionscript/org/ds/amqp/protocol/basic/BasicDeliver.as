/*
Documentation

    This method delivers a message to the client, via a consumer.  In
    the asynchronous message delivery model, the client starts a
    consumer using the Consume method, then the server responds with
    Deliver methods as and when messages arrive for that consumer.
  nameruletestamq_basic_19content
    The server SHOULD track the number of times a message has been
    delivered to clients and when a message is redelivered a certain
    number of times - e.g. 5 times - without being acknowledged, the
    server SHOULD consider the message to be unprocessable (possibly
    causing client applications to abort), and move the message to a
    dead letter queue.
