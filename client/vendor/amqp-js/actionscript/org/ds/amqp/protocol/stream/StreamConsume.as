/*
Documentation

    This method asks the server to start a "consumer", which is a
    transient request for messages from a specific queue. Consumers
    last as long as the channel they were created on, or until the
    client cancels them.
  namerulecontent
    The server SHOULD support at least 16 consumers per queue, unless
    the queue was declared as private, and ideally, impose no limit
    except as defined by available resources.
  namerulecontent
    Streaming applications SHOULD use different channels to select
    different streaming resolutions. AMQP makes no provision for
    filtering and/or transforming streams except on the basis of
    priority-based selective delivery of individual messages.
