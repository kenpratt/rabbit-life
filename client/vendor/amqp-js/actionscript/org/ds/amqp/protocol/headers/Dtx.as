Documentation

  Distributed transactions provide so-called "2-phase commit".    The
  AMQP distributed transaction model supports the X-Open XA
  architecture and other distributed transaction implementations.
  The Dtx class assumes that the server has a private communications
  channel (not AMQP) to a distributed transaction coordinator.
